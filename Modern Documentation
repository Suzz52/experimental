# Modern Approach to Safety Documentation in Automotive & Embedded Systems

## Why PDF-Based Safety Manuals Feel Outdated

Traditional **PDF-based safety manuals** introduce several inefficiencies in modern automotive and embedded system development:

1. **Static & Hard to Maintain** – Updates require regenerating and redistributing PDFs, making maintenance cumbersome compared to version-controlled documentation.
2. **Lack of Traceability & Automation** – Safety compliance needs traceability across development artifacts, but PDFs are disconnected from real-time tools like **JIRA, DOORS, or MBSE tools**.
3. **Not Machine-Readable** – Extracting information for automated compliance checks is difficult. Formats like **JSON, YAML, or structured documentation (Asciidoc, Markdown)** are more automation-friendly.
4. **Inefficient Collaboration** – Modern teams use tools like **Confluence, Git-based wikis, or live documentation portals** (e.g., Sphinx, Doxygen, MkDocs). PDFs make collaboration cumbersome.
5. **Difficult Integration with DevOps Pipelines** – Safety documentation should be **auto-generated** from the source of truth (e.g., code, models, requirements) and version-controlled.

## Transitioning to an Automation-Friendly Safety Documentation Approach

### 1. Define a Structured Documentation Model
Rather than static documents, structure safety manuals as modular, reusable components:

- **Requirements** → Store in tools like **DOORS, Polarion, Jama, or Markdown in Git**.
- **Design & Safety Concepts** → Represent in **SysML, ARXML, or YAML models**.
- **Hazard Analysis & Risk Assessments (HARA)** → Maintain in a **database (e.g., JSON, YAML)**.
- **Safety Measures & Work Products** → Link to **code, models, and test results**.

### 2. Use Docs-as-Code with Version Control & Automation
Move away from static PDFs and use **Markdown, Asciidoc, or reStructuredText** stored in **Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps)**.

#### Recommended Tools:
- **MkDocs** (Markdown-based, used in Python projects)
- **Sphinx** (used for Python, supports reStructuredText)
- **Doxygen** (for code-linked documentation)
- **Antora** (for large AsciiDoc-based documentation)
- **Pandoc** (to convert between different formats)

#### Example Markdown Safety Manual:
```markdown
# Functional Safety Manual
## Introduction
This document provides the safety mechanisms for XYZ system.

## Hazard Analysis
- **Hazard:** Unexpected braking activation
- **ASIL Level:** ASIL-C
- **Mitigation:** Monitor braking system inputs via redundant sensors
```

### 3. Automate Document Generation
Use tools like:
- **Jenkins/GitHub Actions** – Auto-generate documentation on commits.
- **PlantUML / Graphviz** – For safety diagrams.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – If you want interactive reports with safety data.

#### Example:
A CI/CD pipeline can **auto-generate a safety report** whenever the safety model is updated.

### 4. Maintain Traceability with Hyperlinked Documentation
Rather than embedding static references in PDFs:
- Link sections to **requirements (Polarion, DOORS, Jama)**.
- Auto-generate traceability reports via **GraphQL queries** or **traceability matrices**.

#### Example:
```markdown
# Safety Requirements
- [SR-001] - System shall detect sensor failures. (Linked to HARA Report)
- [SR-002] - ASIL-D redundancy shall be ensured. (Linked to FMEA)
```

### 5. Interactive Documentation Portals
Instead of a static PDF, provide **web-based safety manuals** using:
- **GitHub Pages / MkDocs** – Static but versioned.
- **Docusaurus** – Interactive, great for internal teams.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** – If safety APIs are involved.
- **Eclipse Capella / Model-Based Docs** – If using **MBSE for safety**.

### 6. Compliance & Regulatory Integration
- **ISO 26262 requires traceability** → Docs-as-Code helps generate traceability reports.
- **SPICE requires process documentation** → Automate process reporting from repositories.
- **Tool Qualification & Safety Audits** → Interactive reports help in audits.

## Outcome
 **No more static PDFs**—everything is dynamically generated.  
 **Traceability and compliance are automated.**  
 **Documentation is always in sync with development.**  
 **Easy collaboration via Git instead of scattered Word files.**  

By adopting Docs-as-Code, we can ensure safety documentation remains **maintainable, accessible, and automation-friendly**, aligning with modern **DevOps, CI/CD, and Everything-as-Code** methodologies.
